# GoodFood - Responsive React Website

![GoodFood Logo](/public/completeLogo.png)

Welcome to GoodFood, a responsive React website project developed as part of a presentation for a company interested in enhancing their recipe website. This project was created to showcase ideas and functionalities for the company's website and features a fictitious recipe portal with four main pages: Home, Recipes, Ranking, and Settings.

## Project Overview

GoodFood is a fictitious recipe portal that offers several features for users, including:

- **Home**: A homepage that provides information about the company/brand and showcases the top chefs on the platform.

- **Recipes**: A page that lists all available recipes in card format. Each card displays the dish name, an image of the dish, the chef's name, a rating (using a star-rating system), and a link to access the complete recipe.

- **Ranking**: A page that displays chefs ranked in two ways: by "GF Rating" (GoodFood Rating) and by "Worldwide Ranking." Users can sort the list using both criteria.

- **Settings**: A page where users can personalize four aspects of the site:
  - Primary Theme: Choose a color palette for the main theme of the site.
  - Favorite Color: Select your favorite color to highlight elements on the site.
  - Font Size: Adjust the font size for improved readability.
  - Animation Speed: Configure the speed of animations on the site.

The project uses React for the user interface, React Router for managing routes, simulates a database with JSON files to store recipe and chef information, and includes a logo and color palette created solely for demonstration purposes and not intended for the final client.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The primary library for user interface development.
- **React Router**: Used for route management in the application.
- **JSON**: Utilized to simulate a database and store recipe and chef information.
- **CSS**: Styling for pages and components.
